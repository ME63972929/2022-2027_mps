Here lies a simple API to find all the selected and nominated members of parliament in Kenya for the election year 2022 - 2027.

Do with it as you please, be it making a well detailed web page of all the MPs vote and stance on the controversial 2023 Finance Bill, or keeping a well detailed track of how much funds were disbursed in their constituencies, or a detailed breakdown of their financial/stock holdings, net worth, e.t.c

PS: I suck at documentation, so, this will have to suffice for now, the API is very simplistic, and I'm open to all contributions and/or ideas.
